# AWS Console Keyboard shortcuts

This userscript teaches the AWS Console to open the *Services* menu when you press the <kbd>.</kbd> key (a bit like JIRA's shortcut menu).

You can then type the name of the service you want to go to and hit enter.

You can also close the Services menu by pressing <kbd>Escape</kbd>.
